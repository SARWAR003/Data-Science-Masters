    "3. APIs: Many websites have APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. This can be a more efficient way to collect data than web scraping, as the data is already in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Manual data entry: While not technically web scraping, manual data entry involves manually copying and pasting data from a website into a spreadsheet or database. This method is usually only used when the data is only available on a small number of pages or when the data is not easily extractable using other methods."
